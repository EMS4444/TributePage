         <hr> 
         <div class="timeline"> 
            <p>Regarded as <strong>one of the fiercest generals</strong> of his time, he succeeded <strong>Artemio Ricarte</strong> as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. He sought to apply his background in military science to the fledgling army. A sharpshooter himself, he organized professional guerrilla soldiers later to be known as the <strong>"Luna Sharpshooters"</strong> and the <strong>"Black Guard"</strong>. His three-tier defense, now known as the <strong>Luna Defense Line</strong>, gave the American troops a hard campaign in the provinces north of Manila. This defense line culminated in the creation of a military base in the Cordillera. Despite his commitment to discipline the army and serve the Republic which attracted the admiration of people, his temper caused some to abhor him. His efforts were not without recognition during his time, for he was awarded the Philippine Republic Medal in 1899 and he was also a member of the Malolos Congress.  </p>

         <h3 id="headline">Facts about Luna:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Besides his military studies, Luna also studied pharmacy, literature and chemistry.</li>
            <li><strong>Rizal and Luna almost had a Duel</strong> - While in Spain, both Rizal and Luna courted the half-French half-Filipina beauty Nelly Boustead, although it was soon clear that she favored Rizal. Embittered, a drunken Luna made some unsavory remarks towards her in a Filipino party where Rizal was also a guest. The two friends exchanged heated words, with one of them issuing a challenge to a duel. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and Luna apologized to Rizal as soon as he sobered up. </li>
            <li>Like Mabini, Luna correctly suspected that the Americans were not there as liberators, but as substitutes for the Spanish. He deduced that the only way to win against the Americans was to execute a pre-emptive attack on their troops before more could land in Manila. However, his plan was rejected by Aguinaldo and his associates who continued to believe in the Americans’ good intentions. This very unwise decision allowed the Americans to start and dictate the war on their own terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Luna helped establish the first military academy for Filipinos</strong> - A precursor to today’s Philippine Military Academy, the Academia Militar was Luna’s brainchild. Due to his desire to build a professional army, he gained permission from Aguinaldo to set up a military academy in Malolos. He recruited veteran officers of the Filipino-Spanish War as instructors and instilled a strong sense of discipline among the recruits which also included soldiers from the same war. He wanted the men to discard their clan loyalties and look beyond their regional ties. During this time, he also stockpiled arms and weapons and improved the logistics of the Filipino forces.</li>
         <li><strong>A bag of coins stopped a bullet from killing Him</strong> - One of the most fortuitous events in Luna’s life happened during the Battle of Sto. Tomas. Charging with his horse against the American lines, Luna fell to the ground when he was hit by an American bullet to the stomach. Seeing that the Americans were advancing, he prepared to kill himself with a revolver to avoid capture. Luckily, he was saved by the horse-riding Colonel Alejandro Avecilla who took him to safety. Upon reaching friendly lines, he checked his wound one more time and realized that the bag of coins he had been carrying stopped the bullet from completely penetrating his stomach.</li>
         <li><strong> Even the Americans admired Him</strong> - Even though the Americans had a low regard for the Filipino rebels, their generals still held a begrudging respect for Luna. After hearing of his untimely death, many paid tribute to the fallen general. General Frederick Funston, the man who planned the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo, remarked that he was “the ablest and most aggressive leader of the Filipino Republic.”</li>
